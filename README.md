# WebDevLab1_Snake
This is a snake game made for Lab 1 of Web Development
I have used a javascript libary called p5.js (https://p5js.org/) which i have been using before this course as you can see in my old projects in github.
To start the game you need to just open up index.html which can be found in the folder Snake.
